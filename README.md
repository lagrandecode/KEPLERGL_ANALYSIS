# KEPLERGL_ANALYSIS
Today, I decided to hone my data science skills by learning keplergl, one of the most powerful open source geospatial analysis libraries in Python.  In less than 10min, I was able to create boundaries to detect the coverages of all vocational centres in Lagos State, filter and also add a heatmap. One of the things I like best about this library is that it allows me to quickly do a lot of things that I couldn’t do with ARCGIS or QGIS.
